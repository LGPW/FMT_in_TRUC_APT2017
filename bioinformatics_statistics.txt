OTU-based alph- and beta-diversity analysis in QIIME v. 1.8.0 [38] 
Analysis based on a de novo OTU picking strategy using pick_open_reference_otus.py. 
Basic microbiota analysis was performed with QIIME’s diversity analysis workflow core_diversity_analysis.py. 
Microbial diversity and richness was determined by observed species, chao1, PD whole tree and Simpson's index
Differences were calculated using compare_alpha_diversity.py, based on a nonparametric two sample t-test and 999 Monte-Carlo permutations and bonferroni corrected multiple comparisons. 
Taxonomic microbial similarities were calculated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance metrics. 
Differences were calculated with comparing_categegories.py using ANOSIM a nonparametric test using 999 permutations computing an R and a p-value.


Identification of differentially abundant OTUs between groups with LEfSe v. 1.0 [41]
Taxa differences and LDA scores (significantly discriminative features: LDA >2.0 , alpha value for the factorial Kruskal-Wallis test among classes and for the pairwise Wilcoxon test between subclasses >0.05, using all-against-all multi-class analysis) were calculated according to LEfSe.

P-values below 0,05 were considered significant (P<0.05=*; P<0.01=**; P<0.001=***). 
Presented values are always mean ± SEM if not indicated in another way.
